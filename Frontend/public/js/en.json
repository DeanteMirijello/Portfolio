  "about.intro": "I’m Deante Mirijello, a Computer Science student in Montreal who enjoys building full-stack software that solves real, practical problems. I like working across the stack—from backend APIs and data modeling to clean, accessible frontend interfaces—and I’m always trying to improve both code quality and user experience. I value teamwork, clear communication, and writing maintainable software that can grow over time. In the future, I’m looking for opportunities where I can keep learning from experienced developers, contribute to real production projects, and evolve into a strong software engineer focused on building reliable applications that people actually use.",
